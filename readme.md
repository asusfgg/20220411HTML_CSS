# Highlight.js CDN Assets

[![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=highlight.js)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=highlight.js)

**This package contains only the CDN build assets of highlight.js.**

This may be what you want if you'd like to install the pre-built distributable highlight.js client-side assets via NPM. If you're wanting to use highlight.js mainly on the server-side you likely want the [highlight.js][1] package instead.

To access these files via CDN:<br>
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/

**If you just want a single .js file with the common languages built-in:
<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/highlight.min.js>**
