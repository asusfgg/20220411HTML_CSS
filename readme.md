# Highlight.js CDN Assets

[![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=highlight.js)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=highlight.js)

**This package contains only the CDN build assets of highlight.js.**

This may be what you want if you'd like to install the pre-built distributable highlight.js client-side assets via NPM. If you're wanting to use highlight.js mainly on the server-side you likely want the [highlight.js][1] package instead.

To access these files via CDN:<br>
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/

**If you just want a single .js file with the common languages built-in:
<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/highlight.min.js>**

---

## Highlight.js

Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in
the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any
markup, doesn’t depend on any framework, and has automatic language
detection.
